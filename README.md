# tg-ui-contest

Line Chart JS component with chart map to navigate

Notes:

1. tgChart JavaScript file should be splitted into modules. Haven't done it because did not want to use anything like Webpack.

2. tgChart JavaScript file should be minified.

3. Cursor panel with values should be positioned to not overlap with value points

4. Massive usage of ES6 features like template strings, arrow functions, Object.keys method, etc. Because implied to test with latest version of Chrome.
